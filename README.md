# DCS_C-17A_Globemaster_III
The new git repo for the C-17A Flyable in DCS World.

This is extremely work in progress - WIP

At this time the mod Fercho 1-1 and I have put together is broken due to DCS updates to the Flaming Cliffs 3 package and the syntax errors that were created in the FC2024 modules.
The syntax that is required to slot into FC3 based mod aircraft has changed drastically and has broken the flight model assembled in our SFM scripts.

This is our attempt to make the C17 standalone from scratch.

Please bare with us as this will be done slowly but surely. As life likes to play games the same way we do.
